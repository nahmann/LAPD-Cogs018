# Overview
Our project aims to shine light on the issues of crime rate in Los Angeles county and explores its relationship with the locations of police stations. By utilizing the data of crime records collected by the LA Police Department from 2010-present combined with current locations of LAPD police stations, we attempted a geographic data analysis and discovered trends in crime types and the locations associated with it. We found that only a small percentage of crime happens near police stations, and that most crimes are out of reach from current stations.

Furthermore, we performed clustering algorithms using K-Means that propose alternative/new locations for police stations around the county to more effectively distribute station locations, and we found that severe crimes tend to happen less near our new proposed police stations. To conclude, our solutions showed that there are positive impacts that could be made through exploring new police locations and that by doing so we can more evenly spread out crime among police stations and distribute resources of the police department more efficiently.
