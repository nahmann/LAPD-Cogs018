    "Our project aims to shine light on the issues of crime rate in Los Angeles county and explores its relationship with the locations of police stations. By utilizing the data of crime records collected by the LA Police Department from 2010-present combined with current locations of LAPD police stations, we attempted a geographic data analysis and discovered trends in crime types and the locations associated with it. We found that only a small percentage of crime happens near police stations, and that most crimes are out of reach from current stations. \n",

    "Los Angeles has solidified itself as a historic city in America, with positive connotations such as art and film, along with negative ones such as crime rate. The latter has especially had an impact on the culture surrounding the city, as policing of the area has only grown to be more controversial. The city has observed a wide variety of crimes, ranging from petty theft to mass shootings. Due to how controversial the policing of the country has been, especially with the increasing prevalence of movements like BLM, Los Angeles has had the effectiveness of its law enforcement questioned. NPR discusses this topic during Planet Money: \"When You Add More Police To A City, What Happens?\"[^NPR], which explores how effective mass policing is for cities with varying levels of crime. Economists appear to have evidence that increasing the police force for the average city helps to prevent crime overall, but this is not observed in certain areas with a larger Black population. While there is an increase in arrests for lower level crimes, it seems that the homicide rate is effectively left unchanged. The article points to areas in the South and Midwest with this description, so our group wanted to consider the West Coast and specifically Los Angeles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Violence Project[^Violence] takes a comprehensive look at mass shootings from around the country in the past sixty years, with a total of 187 up to March 2021. The database contains over 200 different variables to preview, allowing someone to explore motivations, weapons, background, etc. The website directly provides the ability to filter through the list of shooters, and additionally contains statistics on how prevalent they are in the data. This project in particular is focused exclusively on mass shootings and contains less than 200 rows of data (thankfully), so we decided to expand our project to all forms of crime within LA county.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of the former in mind, we settled on investigating how the proximity of police stations may impact the crime in certain parts of Los Angeles. A common train of thought is that less crime would happen around police stations because they would act as deterents against crime. One related study found that crime rate increased around areas where a police station closed [^blesse]. They suggested that this supported previous papers claiming that more police stations are effective at detering crime, but that the measurement of deterence is hard to calculate. Another paper found more some actual numbers, stating that police stations in Buenos Aires created a 500-600m zone of decreased crime [^fondevila]. This is more in line with what we would like to investigate. By considering location data, we can see if police station prescene has any effects on the number of crimes or on the types of crimes commited.\n",

    "One of the main bias issues in our dataset, is that it only contains reported crimes. Since crimes must be reported by police officers, they inherently are linked to the prescence of a nearby police station. While we would expect this to increase volume of crimes reported nearby police stations, our hypothesis goes against that expectation by assuming that the deterence of a police station will outweight this effect. In order to address this we will carefully word our analysis descriptions and take this into account in our conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential bias in our dataset is that since it is only covering the area of Los Angeles and might not be representative of crime in general for the rest of the state/nation; furthermore, our data could also have an imbalanced proportion of populations due to the nature of policing and crime. In particular, the overpolicing of low income and minority areas could skew our analyses results and present problematic solutions. To tackle this problem, we will carefully analyze for these patterns in our dataset and point them out if/when they arise, as well as preface our solutions with a warning.\n",

    "Privacy should be well protected because the records do not include the names of the victim or culprit. The only thing that links the crime to the people involved is the Division of Records Number serving as an ID of each crime. However only the Los Angeles Police Department has access to the records. In addition to this, the Los Angeles Police Department specified in the description that they round the addresses to the nearest hundred blocks to protect privacy."

    "Several key findings were discovered from our analyses of crimes and police station in LA County. We first asked the question whether crime happen more or less frequently around police stations and can that knowledge be used to more effectively distribute police station locations? To answer this question we hypothesized that less crime will happen closer to police stations which would imply that the presence of a police station deters crime. If criminal activity happens less around police stations then it would be important to effectively spread out police stations in order to minimize crime rate as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our exploratory data analysis, we found that the occurence of crime differs significantly among precincts/stations, there is a difference of 70,000 crimes committed between the minimum and maximum. Despite this range, a large amount of the precincts do have similar amounts of crimes committed within them. On the other hand, due to the variance in the size of the precincts, we saw large differences in Crime / Area value, and some precincts have a much more concentrated Crime / Area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach of creating new locations for police stations using a Kmeans algorithm and ArcGIS algorithm led to significant findings. When we first tried to use Kmeans on the whole dataset, we did not find any signficant improvement on how crime is distributed, which means that we could not support our hypothesis. However, we further explored this subject by narrowing down the types of crimes that actually matter by analyzing \"serious\" crimes. By framing the question this way, we see that crimes are more evenly spread out among the 21 new locations created by the Kmeans algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solidify our findings and answer our hypothesis, we visualized how close crimes happen to police stations and how much crime happens near a police station. Performing this analysis gave us clarification on whether to confirm or deny our hypothesis which was that 'We believe that less crime will happen closer to police stations' since police stations are referred to a safe area and would logically deter crime. From this analysis, we saw that crimes generally happen outside of the range of police stations, with only a select few stations where more crimes happen near a police station. This is a good thing, it helps in suggesting that our hypothesis is correct in that less crimes should happen near police stations. However to either reject or support our hypothesis, we need to do further analysis on this result by plotting the new station locations and performing extensive statistical analyses on the crime coverage of these new locations compared to the current police stations."
