    "We would need at least 2 datasets in order to answer our question. One of the datasets would simply be a list of police stations. We would need to know the location of each station and ideally would have a very precise measurement for the location so that we can accurately determine distances using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other dataset would consist of crime data. Most importantly it would contain the location information of the crime, again, as precise as possible for calculations. Additionally, it would be nice to have information on what police station had jurisdiction over the crime so we could see if it matches up with any distance calculation. Lastly, we could do further analysis if the crime data contained information about the type of crime or other details that could be used for more in-depth analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these datasets are feasible to find. Many cities post crime data and often include some form of location for the crime, whether it be district or nearby street intersection. Additionally, information of police station locations is public and can be found on GPS services even if an explicity dataset does not exist for a city."

    "One potential problem/bias in the dataset is that it will only include criminal activity of reported crimes. This means that by default the crimes had to be caught and would likely be close to police stations in order for them to respond. Areas not covered well by police stations would likely allow some crimes to slip under the radar. \n"
    "Since our question directly compares crimes close and far from police stations this could prove problematic and go against our hypothesis. We will handle this issue by being careful in our wording to not be misleading to readers, as well as provide visualizations that presents this bias/problem clearly to readers.\n"
    "Another potential bias in our dataset is that since it is only covering the area of Los Angeles, it might not be representative of crime in general for the rest of the state/nation, furthermore, our data could also have an imbalanced proportion of populations due to the nature of policing and crime, in particular, the overpolicing of low income and minority areas could skew our analyses results and present problematic solutions.\n" 
    "To tackle this problem, we will carefully analyze for these patterns in our dataset and point them out if/when they arise, as well as preface our solutions with a warning.\n"
    "Privacy should be well protected because the records do not include the names of the victim or culprit. The only thing that links the crime to the people involved is the Division of Records Number serving as an ID of each crime. However only the Los Angeles Police Department has access to the records. In addition to this, the Los Angeles Police Department specified in the description that they round the addresses to the nearest hundred blocks to protect privacy."
