    "We would need at least 2 datasets in order to answer our question. One of the datasets would simply be a list of police stations. We would need to know the location of each station and ideally would have a very precise measurement for the location so that we can accurately determine distances using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other dataset would consist of crime data. Most importantly it would contain the location information of the crime, again, as precise as possible for calculations. Additionally, it would be nice to have information on what police station had jurisdiction over the crime so we could see if it matches up with any distance calculation. Lastly, we could do further analysis if the crime data contained information about the type of crime or other details that could be used for more in-depth analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these datasets are feasible to find. Many cities post crime data and often include some form of location for the crime, whether it be district or nearby street intersection. Additionally, information of police station locations is public and can be found on GPS services even if an explicity dataset does not exist for a city."

This means that by default the crimes had to be caught and would likely be close to police stations in order for them to respond. Areas not covered well by police stations would likely allow some crimes to slip under the radar. Since our question directly compares crimes close and far from police stations this could prove problematic and go against our hypothesis."
